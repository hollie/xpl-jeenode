DESCRIPTION

This is the repository that hosts the firmware for a JeeNode. The idea is to program a JeeNode with this firmware and then to connect it to the xpl-jeenode plugin.

That plugin provides xPL connectivity to the JeeNodes.

Next to the firmware for the JeeNode, this repository also contains an emulator that enables code development without hardware.

USAGE

Either burn the firmware in a JeeNode and connect it to your PC or start the emulator.

Install the xpl-perl framework that you can find here:

http://github.com/hollie/xpl-perl

Start the xpl-jeenode with the following command:

  xpl-jeenode --verbose --device /dev/ttyUSBO

or for the emulator

  xpl-jeenode --verbose --device localhost:2501
